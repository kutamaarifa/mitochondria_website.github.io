            <p>At the core of Mito’s genesis, which started in 2007, is the idea that Africa needs to use its rich mineral resource base to participate in global value chains that also assists it to meet the basic needs of its people. A case in point is the minerals such as the platinum group metals (PGMs) and vanadium which are energy critical elements used in energy generation and storage technologies. South Africa and Zimbabwe are home to the largest deposits of these metals and are renowned for being the largest producers and exporters of these metals. Their participation in the high-end value adding part of their global value chain is minimal.

            <div id="b02001">
            <p >South Africa has been going through an energy crisis since 2008 while the rest of the continent is energy poor. It is within this context that Mito was conceived and established in 2012 with a quadruple imperative of energy services provision, resource-based industrialisation, new industry development in which, by virtue of the technologies we are working with, the development of the PGMs market is central; and climate-change mitigation.</p>
            <p>Mitochondria Energy Company is a technology agnostic (gas to power, energy storage etc), customer-centric and service-dominant business. We are committed to contributing to a future in which sustainability will become the de facto standard  of how people live and conduct their business.</p>
            <p>Nature is replete with energy generation technologies that use many different forms of energy resources such as nuclear fission in stars, wave energy from the oceans, chemical energy from cellular organisms such as mitochondria. A comparative analysis of these energy resources is provided below. The graphic shows how renewable energy resources are by far the most abundant</p>
